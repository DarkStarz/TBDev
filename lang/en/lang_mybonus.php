      and yes! this is awarded on a per torrent basis (max of 5) even if there are no leechers on the Torrent you are seeding! <br />
      <h1>Other things that will get you karma points : </h1>
      - Uploading a new torrent = 15 points
      <br />- Putting up an offer = 10 points
      <br />- Filling a request = 10 points
      <br />- Comment on torrent = 3 points
      <br />- Saying thanks = 2 points
      <br />- Rating a torrent = 2 points
      <br />- Making a post = 1 point
      <br />- Starting a topic = 2 points 
      <br />
      <h1>Some things that will cost you karma points:</h1>
      <br />- Upload credit
      <br />- Custom title
      <br />- One month VIP status
      <br />- A 1:1 ratio on a torrent
      <br />- Buying off your warning
      <br />- One month custom smilies for the forums and comments
      <br />- Getting extra invites
      <br />- Giving a gift of karma points to another user
      <br />- Asking for a re-seed
      <br />- Making a request
      <br />- But keep in mind that everything that can get
      you karma can also be lost, <br />ie : if you up a torrent then delete it, you will gain and then lose 15 points, <br />
      making a post and having it deleted will do the same<br /><br />... and there are other hidden bonus karma points all 
      over the site.<br /><br />Yet another way to help out your ratio! 
      <br />- *please note, staff can give or take away 
      points for breaking the rules, or doing good for the community.
